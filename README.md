# **Eucleia** üîê

A foundational mathematics library built in Rust for learning cryptography through hands-on construction.

## **Purpose**

Eucleia provides the mathematical building blocks needed to understand and implement cryptographic algorithms from the ground up. Rather than using existing crypto libraries as black boxes, this project enables you to learn by building.

## **What's Inside**

**Number Theory:** GCD, LCM, prime testing, factorization

**Modular Arithmetic:** Extended Euclidean algorithm, modular inverse, fast exponentiation

**Algebraic Structures:** Fractions, complex numbers

**Geometry:** 2D/3D points, vectors, transformations

**Future:** Direct path to implementing RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curve cryptography

## **Learning Path**

1. Master the mathematical foundations
2. Implement cryptographic primitives using your own tools
3. Build complete systems (RSA, digital signatures, etc.)
4. Understand security concepts through practice

## **Focus**

This library prioritizes **understanding over performance**. Each function is implemented clearly, with comprehensive documentation and examples showing how mathematical concepts translate into working code.

Perfect for students, developers transitioning to cryptography, or anyone who wants to understand what happens under the hood of secure systems.
